# Fiji-Macro-MGV

This repository includes the codes used for Mean Gray Value (MGV) analysis of immunoflorescence images during my PhD. More specifically, for the analysis of PIP and actin levels.

All images were analyszed in Fiji ver 2.9.0

These codes were run as startup macros (Plugins -> Macros -> Startup Macros)
